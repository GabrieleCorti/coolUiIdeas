# Cool UI ideas

This album consists of react UI components with various features. These components don't share any style. These components have some infesting UX interaction and are based on ideas that come to my mind randomly, they are not meant to be really used but just built for fun.

I choose to use react because it is the framework I am better familiar with, so for me it's faster to sketch out ideas quickly. To achieve my desired style, I chose CSS that is plain and simple.
